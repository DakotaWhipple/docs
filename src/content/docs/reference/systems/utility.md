description: Understanding board game-like utility in app design and avoiding feature overload
---
Absolutely, let's unpack that! You’re interested in “adding utility,” especially the kind of *board game-like utility* you find in games such as Wingspan. Let’s explore:

---

### 1. **What Does "Adding Utility" Mean?**

In board games, **utility** often means giving players tools, abilities, or resources that enable them to:

* Interact with the game world in meaningful ways
* Make interesting decisions
* Adapt to different strategies

For example:

* In *Wingspan*, “utility” comes from bird powers, bonus cards, and end-of-round goals—each giving players different ways to score, manipulate the board, or respond to opponents.

---

### 2. **What Does "Too Much Utility" Look Like?**

"Too much utility" in a game/app means **giving players so many tools, options, or abilities that:**

* The game becomes overwhelming or confusing
* Decisions lose impact (everything feels equally viable)
* The core experience becomes diluted (players lose track of what matters)

Examples:

* Games where every turn offers dozens of actions, but none feel special
* Apps where every feature does everything, but no feature is focused or satisfying

---

### 3. **How Does This Apply to App or Product Design?**

If you’re designing an app and want “board game-like utility,” consider:

* **Meaningful choices:** Each feature should empower users to do something valuable or creative, not just exist as a checkbox.
* **Synergy:** Like in *Wingspan*, where bird powers interact, features should *work together* for bigger effects.
* **Progression:** Allow users to unlock new “tools” or powers as they go, increasing their options without overwhelming them from the start.
* **Limits:** Too much early utility can overwhelm; introduce utility gradually and with purpose.

---

### 4. **What is the "Sweet Spot" for Utility?**

* **Just Enough:** Users have enough tools to be creative and adapt, but not so many they’re paralyzed by choice.
* **Distinctive Powers:** Each option or feature should feel *different* and *useful* in specific contexts.
* **Strategy Emerges:** Like in Wingspan, strategy emerges from *how* you use your utility, not *how much* you have.

---

### 5. **Practical Example:**

* **Too Little Utility:** A note app with only “write note” and “delete note.”
* **Too Much Utility:** A note app with endless buttons—mind maps, AI suggestions, reminders, color coding, sharing, exporting, importing, plugin marketplace—without clear use or guidance.
* **Board Game-Like Utility:** A note app where each added tool (“link notes,” “tag,” “summarize,” “turn into flashcard”) feels *purposeful* and helps users build systems that suit their style.

### 6. **Summary Table**

| Level      | What It Feels Like                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Too Little | Boring, repetitive, few choices                     |
| Just Right | Interesting combos, real decisions, user creativity |
| Too Much   | Overwhelming, confusing, “feature soup”             |

---

#### **TL;DR:**

*Board game-like utility* is about giving users tools that are fun, strategic, and meaningful—but not so many that it becomes chaos. The best utility is focused, synergistic, and unlocks creativity or clever decision-making, just like a well-designed board game. It provides flexibility without overwhelming options.
