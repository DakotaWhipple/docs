| **Part**        | **Description**                                                                |

| **Input**       | What the system receives from the environment to operate on                    |
| **Process**     | The transformation applied to the input within the system                      |
| **Output**      | The result or product that comes out of the system                             |
| **Components**  | The internal parts that perform specific functions (e.g., subsystems, modules) |
| **Boundaries**  | The limits of the system—what's inside vs. what's external                     |
| **Environment** | The external context or conditions the system interacts with                   |
| **Feedback**    | Information sent back into the system to adjust or improve its operation       |
| **Control**     | Mechanisms that guide or govern the system’s behavior                          |
| **Interface**   | How parts of the system or system/environment interact                         |
| **State**       | The internal condition of the system at a given time                           |
