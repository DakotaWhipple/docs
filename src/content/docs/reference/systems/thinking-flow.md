In the **thinking flow** of someone who designs for *leverage and compounding systems*, **capabilities** are *not* the starting point — they’re the *middle layer*. Before you get to *capabilities*, there’s a deeper substrate that defines what those capabilities are even *for*.

Here’s the natural progression that precedes capabilities:

---

## 🧩 1. **Orientation (the vector of attention)**

> “Where am I pointing my awareness and why?”

This is before skill or ability — it’s the *axis* your thinking aligns on.
It’s how you decide what even counts as “progress.”

**Examples:**

* Am I optimizing for personal growth, team leverage, or systemic harmony?
* Am I seeing the system as a machine or as an organism?
* Do I care about elegance, efficiency, or adaptability?

**Without orientation**, your capabilities scatter — they’re powerful but directionless.

---

## 🧠 2. **Model (mental structure of reality)**

> “What is true about how this system works?”

Before capability comes *understanding*. You form a *model* — an internal simulation of the environment that lets you predict how interventions ripple.

**Examples:**

* Knowing how incentives drive behavior in organizations.
* Understanding dataflow through distributed systems.
* Seeing patterns across domains — how orchestration, state, and coordination generalize.

Capabilities emerge *within* a model. Without it, you have raw skill but no predictive leverage.

---

## 🔭 3. **Intent (why the system should exist)**

> “What outcome am I trying to create in the world?”

Intent is the emotional + conceptual north star — it gives your models purpose.
It defines the *boundaries* of what’s worth building capability for.

**Examples:**

* To make creation itself faster and more fluid.
* To align human and machine orchestration.
* To reduce friction between ideas and implementation.

Capabilities are *servants* of intent — not the other way around.

---

## ⚙️ 4. **Capabilities (what the system can do)**

Now comes your **toolset** — the actions your model and intent allow.
Capabilities are things like:

* Designing architectures
* Automating feedback loops
* Building adaptive interfaces
* Thinking recursively

They’re emergent — not initial.
Capabilities are *how* your intent manifests *within* the model you understand and the orientation you maintain.

## 🧬 Flow Summary

| Layer            | Question                      | Function                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Orientation**  | “Where am I looking and why?” | Aligns perspective                  |
| **Model**        | “What is true?”               | Enables understanding               |
| **Intent**       | “What do I want to cause?”    | Provides motivation                 |
| **Capabilities** | “What can I do?”              | Enables execution                   |
| **Outcomes**     | “What did I change?”          | Closes the loop & compounds insight |

If you think like a **compounding system designer**, this flow becomes cyclical:
**Outcomes** feed new **orientation** — your perception expands, and new capabilities emerge.

Would you like me to map this flow visually (like a feedback diagram showing how each layer compounds into the next)?
