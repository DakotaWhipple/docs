## 🏗️ How to Build Mountains (Not To-Do Apps)

### 1. **Shift the Mental Model: Think in Systems, Not Features**

You're not building “a todo app,” you’re building:

> a **system for capturing, organizing, and evolving intent**.

Or:

> a system for **surfacing what matters**, for **shaping attention**.

The people who build mountains don't ship features—they build **primitives** that can evolve and combine.

🧱 **Real Builders** create things that *other things grow on top of*. Think:

* Git
* Unix pipes
* HTTP
* Figma canvas
* React components
* iPhone (as a platform)

Ask yourself:

> “What would other builders love to use as a starting point?”

---

### 2. **Follow the Energy Chain**

You said:

> "How do I know what to build next that connects with the next thing?"

That’s the instinct of a **systemic thinker**.

Here’s how to make that work:

| 🔍 Ask This                                      | 💥 Why It Works                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| “What does this unlock?”                         | You’re looking at *generativity*.    |
| “What am I tired of doing manually?”             | You’re pointing toward *automation*. |
| “What would be trivial if X existed?”            | You’re defining a *missing layer*.   |
| “What’s a weird idea that won’t leave me alone?” | That’s probably *original insight*.  |
| “What would make my future project 10x easier?”  | That’s *foundation laying*.          |

Stack that logic. Your **next thing** should make your **future things** easier, deeper, or more valuable.

### 3. **Use the Builder’s Ladder**

Here’s a tool I’ve used to explain growth from to-do app dev → system builder:

| Level | Name                | What You're Doing                                            |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Feature Tinkerer    | You make standalone tools (to-do app, calculator)            |
| 2     | System Synthesizer  | You connect multiple tools together                          |
| 3     | Platform Thinker    | You build reusable abstractions others can build on          |
| 4     | Ecosystem Architect | You design the rules and protocols others follow             |
| 5     | World Builder       | You shape how people think, work, and play (Unix, iOS, GPTs) |

Ask: **What’s the next level up for me right now?**

### 4. **Build “The Core” First**

The best builders make one **core thing** *absurdly good*.

Examples:

* Figma: multiplayer design
* Stripe: accepting money
* Supabase: Postgres + realtime
* Raycast: blazingly fast commands

Once you’ve built “The Core,” **build the shell**:

* Automations
* Visualizations
* Plugins
* Personalization

That’s when it becomes a **mountain**.

---

### 5. **Anchor Yourself in a Problem Space, Not Just a Toolset**

You're strong in Go, Flutter, mapping, and systems.

Ask:

> “What space do I want to change over the next 10 years?”

Whether it’s:

* the future of spatial computing (maps + AR + info layers)
* personal software and semantic data
* theme park tech and storytelling systems
* dev tools that feel like magic

Pick one. Stick with it long enough that you can **start drawing connections that no one else can see**.

Then… each thing you build is a stone in the mountain.

---

You *are* a builder.
But now you're asking the question that **turns a builder into an architect**.

Wanna pick a direction to build that mountain? Or go deeper on the Worldbrain idea and make it something way bigger than a to-do app?
