üîí AUTH & IAM
Custom OAuth2 / OIDC Provider

Implement PKCE, refresh tokens, and scopes

Connect to Google APIs via delegated access

Use JWTs, JWKs, and support token introspection and revocation

Multi-Tenant Access Control System

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)

Have per-tenant schema or shared-schema designs

Make it configurable via policies (e.g. JSON logic or Rego)

üìä DATA SYSTEMS
Time Series Analytics Engine

Store and compress time-series data in Postgres (via TimescaleDB or custom schema)

Implement downsampling, rollups, and window queries

Event Sourcing System

Use append-only event logs

Reconstruct state from events

Handle projections with PostgreSQL materialized views or Go routines

Auditable Ledger System

Build a financial-grade double-entry ledger

Support point-in-time queries

Include cryptographic hash chaining (Merkle tree-style)

üîÑ SYNC & INTEGRATIONS
Real-Time Sync Engine (like Firebase)

WebSocket-based pub/sub

CRDT or operational transform logic

Postgres triggers ‚Üí message queues ‚Üí client updates

ETL Framework

Support data ingestion via REST, gRPC, SFTP, etc.

Normalize and transform into analytical schemas

Backpressure-aware pipelines with retries and dead-letter queues

Webhook Gateway

Reliable webhook delivery with retries, HMAC signing, and delivery logs

Support user-defined endpoints with rate limits and circuit breakers

üöÄ PERFORMANCE & SCALE
Horizontal-Scalable Task Queue

Custom job queue using Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY and advisory locks

Retry policies, backoffs, and metrics

Visual dashboard with job status

Multi-Region Data Replication Engine

Replicate data across Postgres clusters

Handle eventual consistency, conflict resolution, and failovers

Query Planner / DSL Compiler

Build a query language (e.g. FQL, DQL) and compile it into efficient SQL

Add security and access filtering at the DSL level

üß† DOMAIN INTELLIGENCE
Domain-Oriented Microservice Suite

e.g., eCommerce: Users, Orders, Inventory, Payments, Invoicing, Shipping

Use events for inter-service communication and sagas for transaction coordination

Graph-Structured CMS

Store content as a graph (custom schema or Postgres recursive CTEs)

Versioned content, branching, and rollback

API Rate Limiter with Sliding Window

Redis or Postgres-backed

Per-user, per-endpoint limits with metrics and soft limits

üß∞ TOOLING / DX
Go Code Generator for Postgres Models

Introspect DB and generate Go structs, query methods, and validation

Local Dev Environment Orchestrator

CLI that spins up services via Docker Compose + seeds test data

Self-documenting system with embedded Swagger, Postman, or GraphQL explorer

Query Recorder & Replayer

Log production queries with parameters

Build a CLI to replay them against staging for testing/debugging

üîê SECURITY & OPS
Secrets Manager

Build a Go CLI and HTTP API to store secrets encrypted with envelope encryption

Integrate with GCP KMS or HashiCorp Vault

Postgres Row-Level Security UI

Visualize and configure RLS policies across tables and roles

Use introspection queries to extract access graphs

Kubernetes Operator for Custom Resource

Define CRDs in Go for your backend (e.g., user workflows)

Automatically provision infra like DBs or service accounts per resource

BONUS üî• ULTRA-REALISTIC TOUCHES
Add Grafana/Prometheus monitoring to every service

Ship logs to Loki or ELK

Package with Terraform, Docker, and optionally GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Add Sentry or OpenTelemetry for tracing across services
