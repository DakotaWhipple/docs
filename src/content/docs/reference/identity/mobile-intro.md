title: Mobile Starter
---

If Iâ€™m hiring a **mobile developer** (letâ€™s say Android or iOS, native or cross-platform like Flutter), and I want them to be **immediately valuable**, here's what Iâ€™d **require beyond CS fundamentals**â€”specifically focused on what separates high-leverage mobile devs from average ones:

---

### ðŸš¨ Must-Have Domain Expertise (Mobile-Specific)

#### 1. **App Architecture Patterns (MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.)**

* Understands how to organize large apps:

  * Separation of concerns (UI, domain, data).
  * Dependency injection (e.g., Hilt/Koin/Dagger).
  * Reusability and testability.
* **Why**: Poor architecture kills long-term velocity and leads to spaghetti UI code.

#### 2. **State Management**

* Knows how to handle UI state:

  * In Jetpack Compose, SwiftUI, or Flutter (e.g., Riverpod/Bloc/Provider).
  * Can deal with lifecycles, view states, error/loading/data.
* **Why**: Good state management makes apps feel snappy and bug-free.

#### 3. **Offline-First + Sync**

* Knows local storage (Room/Realm/SharedPrefs/SQLite).
* Understands:

  * Delta sync.
  * Conflict resolution.
  * Background sync (WorkManager, background fetch).
* **Why**: Real-world apps donâ€™t always have a network. This is make-or-break for reliability.

#### 4. **Animations + UI Polish**

* Can implement:

  * Material/SwiftUI transitions.
  * Gesture-driven UIs.
  * Loading skeletons, micro-interactions.
* **Why**: Apps are a product. UX *is* the product. A dev that gets UI polish saves tons of design hand-holding.

#### 5. **Deep Linking + Navigation**

* Knows nav stacks, URI parsing, app intents/schemes.
* Handles push notification routing, dynamic links.
* **Why**: Real apps donâ€™t just open at the home screen. Users come in mid-flow.

### ðŸ‘‘ Bonus That Makes Them Senior Fast

#### - **Release Management**

* Knows beta/internal/release channels.
* Understands store guidelines, review edge cases, crash rollout strategies.
* Handles CI/CD with Gradle/Fastlane/Github Actions.

#### - **Performance Optimization**

* Profiling slow renders, memory leaks, jank.
* Tools like Android Profiler, Instruments.

#### - **Accessibility + Localization**

* Proper text scaling, screen reader support, right-to-left layout handling.
* App is for everyone, not just ideal users.

Summary: If I had to **require just one domain**, itâ€™d be **app architecture patterns + state management**. Everything else builds on that. You can teach animations or CI later, but a messy architecture ruins product velocity.
