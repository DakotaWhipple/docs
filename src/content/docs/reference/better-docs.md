title: Better Docs
---

Building a compelling **documentation website** as a platform for a project. Docs site can *multiply* the visibility, professionalism, and credibility of the project. 

---

**Narrative-Driven Structure**
   Don’t just dump docs — *tell a story*.

   * Explain *why* the project exists (pain points, motivations).
   * Show the journey: problem → solution → impact.
   * Include use cases and opinionated recommendations.

**Interactive Components**

   * Embed live demos (CodeSandbox, embedded app previews, or interactive playgrounds).
   * Live API explorer (e.g. Swagger UI, Redoc, or Postman collection runner).
   * CLI or config generator wizards for quick onboarding.

**Custom Theming & Identity**

   * Branded design: logo, color scheme, tone — make it look owned and intentional.
   * Light/dark mode. Mobile-friendly. Clear typography.
   * Easter eggs or inside jokes if that fits your personality.

**Automated but Beautiful**

   * Auto-generated API references, but with added *handwritten guides* and curated walkthroughs.
   * Include visual diagrams (e.g. Mermaid, Excalidraw-style flows) to stand out.

**Real-World Examples & Showcase**

   * Case studies or screenshots from actual users.
   * “Look what people built with this” section — even if the first example is *you*.

**Search & Speed**

   * Use Algolia DocSearch or similar for blazing-fast search.
   * Keep Lighthouse scores high — treat your doc site like a product.

**Changelog with Personality**

   * Make the changelog part of the site feel alive. Highlight cool features, not just fixes.
   * “What’s New” newsletter or announcement integration.
